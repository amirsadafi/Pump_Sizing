# Pump Selection Tool

This Python script helps users select the appropriate pump type based on their flow rate, pressure, and other requirements. It follows a structured decision tree inspired by an industrial pump selection flowchart.

## How It Works
- The script prompts users to input their flow rate in GPM.
- Based on the flow rate, it asks additional questions regarding pressure, particulate matter, self-priming capability, and other factors.
- After gathering the necessary inputs, it determines and prints the most suitable pump type.

## Usage
Run the script in a Python environment:
```sh
python pump_selection.py
```
Follow the prompts to receive the recommended pump type.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
